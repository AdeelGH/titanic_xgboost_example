# Prediction of Titanic Survivor using XGBoost

Returns three things:
1. The score, which roughly represents the accuracy of the model based on the training data.
2. An array containing the importance of each feature, which represents which columns factors more into which passenger survives. We can observe that gender is the most important one, with more women surviving.
3. Generates a csv file with predictions for additional passengers.
